      <div>
        <p>Streets PAC NJ is a political action committee working to transform New Jersey's streets into safer, more sustainable spaces for all. We believe our communities deserve transportation systems that prioritize people over cars—where children can walk to school safely, cyclists can commute without fear, and public transit is accessible to everyone. Through strategic political engagement, we elect leaders who share our vision of ending traffic violence and building more equitable, environmentally responsible communities.</p>
        <p>Starting in Jersey City, we endorse and support candidates who champion Vision Zero principles, protected bike lanes, robust public transit, and smart urban planning that reduces car dependency. We recognize that safer streets require political will. By mobilizing voters, funding campaigns, and building coalitions, we're turning the dream of safe, livable streets into electoral reality.</p>

    <h1>Issues</h1>

    <place-holder style="width: 343px; height: 142px;"></place-holder>
    <h2>End Traffic Violence Through Vision Zero</h2>
    <p>We advocate for comprehensive Vision Zero policies that treat traffic deaths and serious injuries as preventable—not inevitable. This means redesigning dangerous intersections, implementing proven safety measures like protected bike lanes and pedestrian islands, and enforcing speed limits that protect human life. Every traffic death is one too many, and we support candidates who will prioritize infrastructure changes and policies that save lives.</p>

    <place-holder style="width: 343px; height: 142px;"></place-holder>
    <h2>Build Complete Streets for All Users</h2>
    <p>Our streets should serve everyone—whether you walk, bike, use a wheelchair, push a stroller, or take the bus. We champion Complete Streets designs that include protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, safe crosswalks, dedicated bus lanes, and accessible curb cuts. By supporting leaders who prioritize multi-modal transportation infrastructure, we're creating streets where all residents can move safely and comfortably.</p>

    <place-holder style="width: 343px; height: 142px;"></place-holder>
    <h2>Promote Sustainable Urban Planning</h2>
    <p>Smart growth means building communities where daily needs are within walking or biking distance. We support zoning reforms that encourage mixed-use development, increase housing density near transit, and reduce parking minimums that subsidize car ownership. By backing candidates who understand the connection between land use and transportation, we're fostering neighborhoods where car-free living is not just possible, but preferable.</p>

    <place-holder style="width: 343px; height: 142px;"></place-holder>
    <h2>Advance Environmental Justice</h2>
    <p>Transportation is one of the largest sources of carbon emissions and air pollution, disproportionately affecting low-income communities and communities of color. We fight for policies that reduce vehicle miles traveled, electrify public transit, and create green transportation corridors. Safe streets aren't just about preventing crashes—they're about building a cleaner, healthier future for all New Jersey residents.</p>

    <place-holder style="width: 343px; height: 142px;"></place-holder>
    <h2>Expand Public Transit Access</h2>
    <p>Reliable, frequent, and affordable public transit is the backbone of sustainable cities. We advocate for increased transit funding, expanded bus and light rail service, and transit-oriented development that connects homes to jobs, schools, and services. By electing pro-transit leaders, we can reduce car dependency, cut emissions, and ensure equitable access to opportunity for all residents.</p>

    <h1>Endorsements</h1>
    <p>Streets PAC NJ carefully evaluates candidates based on their commitment to transforming our streets and transportation systems. Through comprehensive questionnaires and in-depth interviews, we identify leaders who will champion protected bike infrastructure, Vision Zero policies, expanded public transit, and smart urban planning. Our endorsements represent more than political support—they're a promise to voters that these candidates will fight for safer, more sustainable, and equitable communities. When you see our endorsement, you know that candidate stands with us in the movement to end traffic violence and build streets that work for everyone, not just cars.</p>
